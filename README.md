#### How does the broker make money
-Interest on cash: 
Fidelity clients are automatically enrolled in cash sweep programs that pay a much higher interest rate than most other brokers make available. Fidelity does make moneyu from the difference betweenn what you are paid on your idle cash and what they can earn on customer cash balances, but it is hard to bregrudge them the money whne they are already paying you an above average rate.
-Stock Loan programs:
Fidelity can also earn revenue loaning stocks in your account for short sales- with your permission, of course-- and it shares that revenue with you.
-Payment for order flow: 
 Fidelity doesn't engage in Payment on ordern flow. This the practice  where a broker accepts payment from a market maker for letting that market maker execute the order. Rather than focus on these payments, Fidelity looks for quality trade executions and ensures that your orders are achieving price improvement on almost every trade.
 -Price improvement:
 Fidelity clients enjoy a healthy rate of price imprpovement on their equity orders, but below average for options. On average, equity orders receive $0.0091 per share in price improvement and options orders receive $0.0342 per contract.
-Portofolio Margining: Fidelity clients who qualify can apply for portofolio margining, which can lower the amount of margin needed based on the overall risk calculated. Typically, portofolio margining works best for customers who trade derivatives that offset the risk inherent in their equity positions.
